\maketitle

\section{Problem formulation}

We consider a problem of applications scheduling in a center with limited power and resources.


This data center runs two different applications : active applications (also called web applications) and batch applications.

\subsection{Active applications}

We consider multiple active applications $\{A_{i}\}, i \in 1..n$, which run continuously over a given amount of time intervals $1..24$.

Each application $A_i$ has, at a given time interval $j$, an execution modes ; each application's mode produces a given power consumption and profit when applied over an interval, with
\begin{description}
 \item[$M_{i,j} \in 1..3$] mode of activity $i$ at time $j$.
 \item[$E_{i,j} \in 0..1000$] power consumption of activity $i$ at time $j$.
 \item[$P_{i,j} \in 0..1000$] profit for running activity $i$ at time $j$.
\end{description}

Those informations can be stored in tables, eg :

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ | l | l | l | l |}
     \hline
      & Mode 1 & Mode 2 & Mode 3 \\ \hline
    $A_1$ & 50 & 60 & 70 \\ \hline
    $A_2$ & 40 & 45 & 55 \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Energy consumption for two active applications}
\end{table}

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ | l | l | l | l |}
    \hline
      & Mode 1 & Mode 2 & Mode 3 \\ \hline
    $A_1$ & 100 & 110 & 120 \\ \hline
    $A_2$ & 90 & 100 & 110 \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Profit for two active applications}
\end{table}

\begin{itemize}
 \item element ($M_{i,j}$, $Row^{Energy}_{i}$, $E_{i,j}$) \% \quad $E_i$=$Row^{Energy}_{i} [M_i]$
 \item element ($M_{i,j}$, $Row^{Profit}_{i}$, $P_{i,j}$) \% \quad $P_i$=$Row^{Profit}_{i} [M_i]$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Batch applications}

We consider multiple batch jobs $\{B_{i}\}, i \in1..m$, each with its own parameters :

\begin{description}
\item [$Duration_i$] is the number of intervals this job must be run before being finished,
\item [$Deadline_i$] deadline is the interval at which the job must be finished,
\item [$Q_i$] $\in 0..1000$ is the profit earnt only if the whole job is finished before or at deadline,
\item [$Power_i$] is the power consumed by the job when it is run over an interval
\end{description}
The batch jobs do not have execution modes.

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ | l | l | l | }
     \hline
      & On & Off \\ \hline
    $B_1$ & 60 & 0 \\ \hline
    $B_2$ & 80 & 0 \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Energy consumption for Batch applications}
\end{table}

Each batch job $i$ can be decomposed in as many subjobs $i,j$ as its duration. We note $S_{i,j}$ the interval at which the $j^{th}$ subjob of jow $i$ is executed.
Since each subjob must be executed over a different time interval,\\
$0< S_{i,1}<S_{i,2}$...$<S_{i,Duration_i}$ .\\
If the job meets its deadline, then also\\
$S_{i,Duration_i}<=Deadline_i$

Energy consumption of batch job $i$ during an interval is $E_{i,j}$, where $i\in$ [1,m] and $j\in$ [1....$Duration_i$]. 
\begin{itemize}
 \item element ($S_{i,Duration_i}$,[.........$Profit_i$, $Pen_i,....$], $Q_i$)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Energy cap}

We also introduce the maximum available energy at $j$ as $Capacity_j$, where $j\in$ [1,24]. Since, in cumulative constraint modeling, the limit of maximum capacity of available energy can not be changed, we introduce fake jobs in each slot to match with the $Capacity_j$. So the maximum capacity is defined as Limit, where Limit = $max (Capacity_{h})$, ${h}\in$ [1,24]. For scheduling purpose we slice the total time i.e., 24/48 hours to 24/48 slots meaning 1 hour as slot and schedule each slot in advance with known information. So, Total Profit is $P=\sum_{i=1}^{n} {P_{i,j}} + \sum_{i=1}^{m} {Q_i}$
 
\begin{itemize}
\item For each active job $A_{i}$ starts at $j$, has duration of 1 slot and height of power consumption is $E_{ij}$, where, $\forall$j $\in$ [1,24]
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item For each batch jobs $B_{i}$ the start time is $S_{ij}$, duration is 1 slot and and height of power consumption is $E_{i}$, where, $\forall$i $\in$ [1,m] and $\forall$j $\in$ [1,$duration_i$]
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item  For every slot ${j}\in$ [1,24] we have a fake job $F_{h}$ that starts at fixed $j$, duration of 1 slot and height of power consumption of $Limit$ - $Capacity_j$, where, $\forall$j $\in$ [1,24]
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Memory use}

The data center contains $l$ servers $\{S_k\}, k\in 1..l$. Each server $S_k$ has a memory capacity $M_k$ which limits the number of applications this server can execute.

Executing an application $A_i$ or a job $B_i$ on a server $S_k$ consumes a fixed amount of memory 
on the server over the execution interval. Reciprocally, each application must be run on a server at any time and any job executed during an interval must be run on a server.

We note
\begin{description}
\item[$HA_{i,j}$] the host of the application $A_i$ during interval $j$
\item[$HB_{i,j}$] the host of the job $B_i$ during interval $j$
\item[$Load_{k,j}$] the memory load of the server $k$ during interval time $j$
\item[$mem(C)$] the memory use of the job or application C.
\end{description}

then we know that

\begin{equation}
Load_{k,j} = \sum_{A_i}(mem(A_i) if HA_{i,j}=k) + \sum_{B_i}(mem(B_i) if HB_{i,j=k}
\end{equation}

\section{Solution formulation}

A solution to such a problem consists in :
\begin{itemize}
\item $\forall$ Active application $A_i$ and time interval $j$, the execution mode $M_{i,j}$ at which to run the appliction during the interval
\item $\forall$ Batch job $B_i$, a series time interval $S_{i,1}..S_{i, Duration_i}$ at which to execute the job.
\item $\forall$ time interval $j$, $\forall$ server $S_k $, the set of Applications and jobs hosted on the server during the time interval.
\end{itemize}
with respect to the previoulsy specified conditions.

\section{Objective}
Our objective function is to maximize $P$,\\
$P=\sum_{i=1}^{n} {P_{i,j}} + \sum_{i=1}^{m} {Q_i}$
